## What is this project?

Its designed to be a hopefully compatible replacement to the OEM DJI mic mini usb C adaptor

## background info

This is what the original looks like

The original is a bit prone to bending if knocked when in use since it sticks out so much

DJI also dont sell a replacement, so any replacement parts are quite expensive, in the £15-20 region.
I thought, hey, i can probably design my own for less.
And i think ive done just that.

A 3d printed case is an optional, but heavily encouraged option.
The 3d printed case helps to support the USB-C port and stop it bending.

If you dont own a 3d printer you could try 
- asking a friend
- your local makerspace
- services like JLC or PCBWAY who offer 3d printing services

## Build instruction

All you should need to make one is 
- a soldering iron
- the PCB
- a 4mm m3 bolt
- the components

First thing you should do is trim the legs of the terminal
you should cut on the red lines

after trimming it should look like this

next step is to solder the USB connector
then solder the terminal on

This animation should help you understand how the case assembles
